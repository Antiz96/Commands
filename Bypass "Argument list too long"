#When there's too much files in a directory (usually +10 000), somes Linux commands doesn't work anymore
#Here's a useful command to bypass this limitation (the idea is to execute the command on each files separetly instead of execute it on all files at the same time)

for i in `ls /path/`; do command /path/$i; done

#Example with a "chown" command
for i in `ls /path/`; do chown root:root /path/$i; done

#Example with a "cp" command combined with a "grep" command
for i in `ls /path/ | grep pdf`; do cp /path/$i /destdir/; done


#If there's still too muche files, just go with something like this to do them 1 by 1
find /nfs/compose_services/GMC-Service/WorkingDirectory -name "*" > /opt/copy.txt

while read line; do cp -rp "$line" /backup/; done < /opt/copy.txt
